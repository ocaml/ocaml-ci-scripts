## Travis CI skeleton for OCaml projects

Instructions:

1. Create an `opam` file at the root of your project. If you use opam
   1.2, you can simply do `opam pin add PKG .` -- this will open an
   editor and propose you a template.

2. Copy `.travis.yml` at the root of your project.

3. Enable Travis runs on
   `https://travis-ci.org/profile/<YOURGITHUBID>` (sign in with your
   Github account and click on `+` on top of the left pane).

And that's it! You can have more control over the things that Travis
CI is testing by looking at the next sections.


### Testing Multiple Compilers

```shell
env:
  - OCAML_VERSION=3.12 [...]
  - OCAML_VERSION=4.00 [...]
  - OCAML_VERSION=4.01 [...]
  - OCAML_VERSION=4.02 [...]
  - OCAML_VERSION=latest [...]
```

Add one line per compiler version you want to test. `latest` is the
latest stable version of OCaml. The `[...]` are other environments
variables set for this Travis CI run (see next sections).


### Setting the Package Name

```shell
env:
  - [...] PACKAGE=<name of your package> [...]
```

By default, the script will use `my-package` as package name, which
might not be what you want if your tests consist of installing reverse
dependencies.


### Basic Run

```shell
env:
  - [...] INSTALL=<bool> [...]
```

By default, the script will start by doing a basic installation
run. Use `INSTALL=false` to disable that run.


### Optional Dependencies

The script will make a run where it will try to install all of the
optional dependencies which are specified before installing the
current package.

This information is read from the `opam` file per default, but it is also
possible to specify sets of optional dependencies that will be tried instead,
e.g. for testing multiple configurations with different set of dependencies.
These package names do not need to be defined in the `opam` file, they can be
any package in the OPAM repository.

```shell
env:
  - [...] DEPOPTS="<list of space-separated package names>" [...]
```


### Extra Dependencies

Optional dependencies will be installed only in the optional dependencies run
but are not available during the normal run. But there might be a case when a
package is required but not part of the `opam` file. One example for this is
`oasis`, which needs to be installed before attempting to build the package.

```shell
env:
  - [...] EXTRA_DEPS="<list of space-separated package names>" [...]
```


### Running the Tests

```shell
env:
  - [...] TESTS=<bool> [...]
```

By default, the script will finish by a test run. Use `TESTS=false` to
disable that run. By sure to have a `build-test` field in your opam file,
otherwise this step is useless.

TODO: check if the `build-test` field is empty in the `opam` file to
know if the tests have to run.


### Hooks

```shell
env:
  - [...] PRE_INSTALL_HOOK="multiple; shell; commands" [...]
  - [...] POST_INSTALL_HOOK="multiple; shell; commands" [...]
```

If you want to execute some commands before or after the installation, use
`PRE_INSTALL_HOOK="command1; command2"` or similarly `POST_INSTALL_HOOK`.
These only get executed when installing your package, not the dependencies.

The hook functionality might be useful for running commands like OASIS to
generate build files which are not checked into the repository.
